# Greetings.
<p>I'm a self-taught coder. I started learning programming from JavaScript.</p>
<p>But while studying, I kept coming across comments that this is a non-language, that you won't become a programmer by studying JS, etc.</p>
<p>As a result, I decided to switch to python. I have studied this language deeply enough, even wrote several applications and 1 game :-).</p>
<p>But at some point I began to come across the same comments again. They were saying the language is dynamically typed, again a non-language for beginners, etc.</p>
<p>And I realized that every language is good in its own way and it's worth writing in what you like best.</p>
<p>And since I still decided to develop towards the Frontend direction, I returned to JavaScript again.</p>
<p>And by that time, I must say, the language had grown up quite a lot. In addition, I learned that the problem of non-strict typing is solved thanks to add-ons over JS like TypeScript of course. Syntactic sugar has appeared in OOP .Appeared generators, decorators, private methods and much more. Now JS was more like a full-fledged programming language, and not just a scripting language.</p>
<p>And so I started my journey with JS anew :-). Simultaneously studying various libraries. I wrote a couple of SPA's on React.</p>
<p>I do not plan to stop and will continue to fill out my profile with projects.</p>
<p>I want to get a normal job where I can learn to understand the language and architectural solutions more deeply.</p>
